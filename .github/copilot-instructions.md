# Hookflow CLI - Copilot Instructions

This repository contains the `hookflow` CLI - a local workflow engine for agentic DevOps.

## Learning & Memory

**Always store memories** when you discover something important about this codebase:
- CI/CD quirks (e.g., golangci-lint requires explicit error handling with `_ =`)
- Cross-platform gotchas (e.g., path separators, `filepath.Match` behavior differs)
- Test patterns that work or don't work
- Build/release process requirements
- Any "lessons learned" from debugging sessions

Use `store_memory` proactively so future sessions don't repeat the same mistakes.

## Shell Standard

**All workflow `run:` steps use PowerShell Core (pwsh)** for cross-platform consistency.
- Same syntax works on Windows, macOS, and Linux
- Users must have `pwsh` installed
- Default shell is always `pwsh`, not OS-dependent
- Helpful error message shown if pwsh is not found

## Development Workflow

1. Make changes to Go code
2. Run tests: `go test ./...`
3. Build: `go build -o bin/hookflow ./cmd/hookflow`
4. Install locally: `go install ./cmd/hookflow`

## Key Components

### Event Detection (`internal/event/`)
- Parses raw Copilot hook input (toolName, toolArgs, cwd)
- Detects event type: file edit, git commit, git push, etc.
- Normalizes paths for cross-platform matching

### Trigger Matching (`internal/trigger/`)
- Matches events against workflow triggers
- Glob patterns with `**` for recursive matching
- Negation with `!` prefix
- **Note**: `filepath.Match` behavior differs by OS

### Expression Engine (`internal/expression/`)
- `${{ }}` syntax with GitHub Actions parity
- Context: `event`, `env`, `steps`
- Functions: `contains()`, `startsWith()`, `endsWith()`, etc.

### Production Logging (`internal/logging/`)
- Logs to `~/.hookflow/logs/hookflow-YYYY-MM-DD.log`
- Enable debug: `HOOKFLOW_DEBUG=1`
- 7-day retention with automatic cleanup
- View with: `hookflow logs`

## Testing

```bash
go test ./... -v              # All tests
go test ./internal/trigger/... -v  # Specific package
go test ./... -coverprofile=coverage.out  # With coverage
```

## CI Requirements

- **golangci-lint with errcheck**: All error returns must be explicitly handled or ignored with `_ =`
- **Cross-platform tests**: Use `runtime.GOOS` checks or skip flags for OS-specific tests
- **Path separators**: Always use forward slashes in test expectations

## Release Process

Releases are automated via `.github/workflows/auto-release.yml`:
1. Push to main triggers version calculation from conventional commits
2. Tests run, binaries built for all platforms
3. GitHub Release created with binaries
4. npm package published (with continue-on-error for OIDC issues)

## Cross-Compilation

```bash
GOOS=windows GOARCH=amd64 go build -o bin/hookflow-windows-amd64.exe ./cmd/hookflow
GOOS=darwin GOARCH=arm64 go build -o bin/hookflow-darwin-arm64 ./cmd/hookflow
GOOS=linux GOARCH=amd64 go build -o bin/hookflow-linux-amd64 ./cmd/hookflow
```
